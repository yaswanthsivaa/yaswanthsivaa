## Quick Intro

I’m building strong fundamentals in **Data Structures & Algorithms using Python** and working on small web projects.  
This profile is a snapshot of my learning journey, consistency, and problem-solving approach.

## What I’m Good At (So Far)

**Core DSA Patterns**
- Arrays · Binary Search · Linked Lists  
- Stack · Strings · Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers · Sorting · Matrix · Math

**Programming**
- Python (primary)  
- Basic Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- Git & GitHub
